# Code insights team (coming soon)

The code insights team will be responsible for building and delivering [**code insights**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EHzor6I1GhVVIpl70mH-c10b1tNEl_p1xRMJ9qHQfoc/edit) to engineering leaders, empowering data-driven decisions in engineering organizations.

## Background

Sourcegraph code insights can tell you things about your code at a high level. Here's a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqeRb6Mc4Co) of a code insights prototype.

Only Sourcegraph can do this because we have universal code search. To know _anything_ about your code at a high level means you must know _everything_ about your code at a low level. 

Code insights connects a lot of features that Sourcegraph already has and builds on top of them; we go beyond single-step code intelligence to help create the full cycle of analyzing, monitoring, and actionably changing a codebase. 

Code insights is the first feature primarily built for non-search-based user personas.

Code insights will combine Sourcegraph-created metrics with other third-party data sources. 

## Goals

1. Expose the value of Sourcegraph's knowledge of your codebase to users at all levels of an organization.
1. Expose generalizable metrics that let our users measure and track their own goals, whether those are migrations, code smells, security needs, cross-collaboration, or other information about code.
1. Expose features that let our users build their own insights.
1. Expose features that let users explore insights by team, repo(s), or other sub-metrics. 
1. Connect code insights to other Sourcegraph features â€“ make a campaign to impact a metric or set up code monitoring to notify you about changes to an insight. 
1. Add plug-and-play integrations to Sourcegraph code insights that let users easily integrate third-party data into their insights. 

## We're hiring for this team!

We are building the code insights team by hiring [frontend engineers](../hiring/software-engineer-frontend.md) and [backend engineers](../hiring/software-engineer-backend.md).
New team members will initially contribute work towards code insights under the umbrella of the [web team](../web/index.md) and split off into their own independent team once we have enough team members.
