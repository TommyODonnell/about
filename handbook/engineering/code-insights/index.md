# Code insights team (coming soon)

The code insights team will be responsible for building and delivering [**code insights**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EHzor6I1GhVVIpl70mH-c10b1tNEl_p1xRMJ9qHQfoc/edit) to engineering leaders, empowering data-driven decisions in engineering organizations.

## Goals

1. Expose the value of Sourcegraph's knowledge of your codebase to users at all levels of an organization.
1. Expose generalizable metrics that let our users measure and track their own goals, whether those are migrations, code smells, security needs, cross-collaboration, or other information about code.
1. Expose features that let our users build their own insights.

## We're hiring for this team!

We are building the code insights team by hiring [frontend engineers](../hiring/software-engineer-frontend.md) and [backend engineers](../hiring/software-engineer-backend.md).
New team members will initially contribute work towards code insights under the umbrella of the [web team](../web/index.md) and split off into their own independent team once we have enough team members.
