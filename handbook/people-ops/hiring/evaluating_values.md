# Evaluating values in an interview

We expect every teammate, team, and our company to live up to the [Sourcegraph values](../../../company/values.md). It is therefore important that we evaluate every candidate on the values to determine how successful they will be within Sourcegraph.

It is the responsibility of every interviewer to think about these values when interviewing a candidate. When submitting feedback for a candidate, copy the list of values into your notes and score the candidate out of 5 based on the rubric.

## Rubric

| Score | Description |
| --- | --- |
| -1 | Exhibited behavior that is contrary to this value. |
| 0 | No evidence towards or against this value (neutral). |
| 1 | Demonstrated this value with evidence. |
| 2 | Exceptionally demonstrated this value, with abundant evidence. |
